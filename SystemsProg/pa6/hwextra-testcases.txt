The following are test cases for the othermalloc.c code.  It contains inputs and expected 
outputs.

::TEST CASE 1::
Allocate a character array with malloc.  
Free the array.
Free 2 bytes behind the array  ->  An error should occur.
Free the array again.  ->  An error should occur.

::TEST CASE 2::
Declare an integer.
Free the integer.  ->  An error should occur.

::TEST CASE 3::
Allocate an array that is almost as large as the large chunk of space.
Allocate an array that is larger than the threshold, but won't be able to fit into the large
chunk of space.
Free both arrays.

As output, there should be a string that says the array was successfully allocated.

::TEST CASE 4::
Allocate an array.
Free the array.
Allocate the array.
Free the array.
Free the array again. 

There should be a single error message indicating that the last free was in error for 
freeing a pointer that was already freed.
